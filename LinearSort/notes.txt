in the Linear sort 
we have to compare elements in a way that first smallest number will settle at the top. and at the end largest number will be at end

the procedure we will follow is
first we will compare 
0th element with 1st element like
5	2	36	-3	6
---------------------------------
0	1
0	2
0	3
0	4
---------- step one complete on 0th index we got the smallest number no2 we will start from 1st element
1	2
1	3
1	4
---------- step 2nd complete on 1th index we got the 2nd smallest number now we will start from 2st element and so on upto 2nd last index
2	3
2	4
----------
3	4
---------------- elements are sorted
